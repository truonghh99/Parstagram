Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I wish I had more time to implement a Direct Message feature using Parse. I could link my direct message icon to a list of message exchanges, which all link to direct message rooms.
2. It would have been nice to implement a gesture recognizer, like double tapping to like a post.
